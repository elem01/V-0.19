Please follow the next steps to be able to flash the firmware.

= Buy STLinkV2 clone =

To be able to flash the firmware (both for TSDZ2 motor controller and KT-LCD3), you will need the cheap clone of STLinkV2, that you can buy on EBay as cheap as 2.3â‚¬.

'''WARNING:''' we found that some STLinkV2 clones can't flash very well the motor controller while other do it well. A good idea is to buy like 3 different STLinkV2 clones, from different shops.

= Wire the STLinkV2 to the LCD3 =

Open the LCD3 and find the flashing pins top right side with label J7. From left to right on J7 pins, connect the  following pins:

* pin1: connect to STLinkV2 5V pin
* pin2: connect to STLinkV2 SWIM pin
* pin3: connect to STLinkV2 GND pin
* pin4: connect to STLinkV2 RST pin

= Download and flash our firmware =
# [https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stvp-stm32.html Download ST Visual Programming utility for Windows here]. This software is from the STM8S105 manufacture for flashing the firmware. NOTE: if you are on Linux or MAC, you can use other alternative tool. For instance, [https://opensourceebikefirmware.bitbucket.io/development_tsdz2/Various--2018.04.18_-_original_firmware_and_debug_session_using_OpenOCD.html on Linux you can use stm8flash].
# A video tutorial is [https://youtu.be/bxEHDFCaKH8]
# [https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2-Smart-EBike/releases Download the firmware hex file from here]. Pick the file with name KT_LCD3_xxxxxx.hex.
# Erase the STM8 as this way the read protection will be disabled. If you don't disable the read protection/erase, next step will fail.
# Finally, flash the firmware.
