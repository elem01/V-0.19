The Bafang 850C LCD is a color display that is manufactured by http://aptdevelop.com/. You can buy  it on many online shops like Ebay, Aliexpress, PSWPower, etc.

This display works from 24V up to 52V (7S up to 14S) battery packs.

'''NOTE:''' an user bought a different version of this LCD that is listed as DPC14 and that has a different hardware where our firmware does not work. If you want to make sure you buy the correct version, [http://www.pswpower.com/ven.php?cargo.2016-5e-2eaj buy from PSWPower the model P850C on this link]. The DPC14 has the same appearance and seems to be a cheaper version with less memory and processing power.
