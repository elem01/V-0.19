'''The following only applies to firmware version 0.18.X!'''

<br>
''' CAUTION: '''
<br>
* Always use the same firmware version for both the motor controller and LCD unless otherwise specified!
* Before using the mid drive with new firmware, you must correctly configure the options on the display. For instance, you should configure your battery low voltage cut off so as not to over discharge the battery. Do set all other parameters also.
* When installing new firmware, always check that no unwanted functions have become enabled or disabled during the install process.
<br>


== 1. Main Screen ==
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Assist Level Field ===
The assist level field displays the active assist level. This sets the motor power as a factor of the power that rider is generating on the pedals. For instance, if current assist level is 3 and if this level is configured as a factor of 2.0, when rider is doing on the pedals a power of 100 watts, the motor power supplied will be 200 watts. The assist level is changed by pressing either UP or DOWN button.
<br><br>
'''NOTES:'''
<br>
* It is possible to configure the number of assist levels (1 to 9) in the configuration menu. 
<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Wheel Speed Field === 
This sub field displays information about speed. The values are displayed in either metric or imperial units and the user can switch between a couple of different speed measurements. The default one is current wheel speed. Other ones are average speed since power on and peak speed since power on.
<br><br>

- <b> Wheel speed: </b> Displays current wheel speed.
<br>
- <b> Average wheel speed: </b> Displays average wheel speed since power on.
<br>
- <b> Peak wheel speed: </b> Displays peak wheel speed since power on.
<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Motor Power Field === 
The motor power field displays instantaneous motor power in watts. In the maximum motor power sub menu you can set a limit to maximum motor power. This can be useful for various reasons, like controlling the battery range for long trips.

It is also possible to access a quick set sub menu by long pressing ON/OFF and UP buttons. Press or hold UP and DOWN buttons to increase or decrease the power limit. Exit sub menu by holding the ON/OFF button. The quick set sub menu cannot be accessed when offroad mode is enabled. Disable offroad mode first.

How it works: the motor controller will automatically limit current and therefore limit maximum motor power. As the battery discharges and the voltage decreases the motor controller will adapt and adjust the current to maintain the set power limit.
<br><br>
'''NOTES:'''
<br>
* It is possible to access a quick set sub menu by long pressing ON/OFF and UP buttons. Press or hold UP and DOWN buttons to increase or decrease the power limit. Exit sub menu by holding the ON/OFF button. The quick set sub menu cannot be accessed when offroad mode is enabled. Disable offroad mode first.

The time measurement field displays elapsed time since power on or since last reset. It displays either the TM symbol, stands for Time Measurement, or TTM symbol, stands for Total Time Measurement. This corresponds to the mentioned "time since power on" and "time since last reset".
<br><br>

- <b> TM: </b> Elapsed time since power on.
<br>
- <b> TTM: </b> Elapsed time since last reset.
<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Battery State of Charge Bar === 
Battery state of charge based on battery voltage. There are 6 different levels. When battery is near empty, the battery symbol will be empty and blinking and the motor power will be reduced up to battery being totally empty.<br>The battery voltage used to calculate the state of charge has in consideration the battery pack resistance to avoid floating when power is being draw from the battery (the battery pack resistance value is set on configurations menu).
<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Lights === 
Enabled or disable LCD backlight, headlights and lights symbol with a long press of UP button. The LCD backlight will change as configured by user.
<br>

The brake symbol lights up when user engages the E-Bike brakes, if installed. This is also useful for checking that the E-Brakes are working properly and thus turn of the motor assistance when applied.
<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Walk Assist === 
Enable or disable walk assist with a long hold of DOWN button at speeds below 8 km/h (approximately 5 mph). The motor will start to give assistance and maintain a walking pace. At the same time the walk assist symbol will light up. To set different power levels simply select appropriate assist level. The power levels can be configured in the configuration menu.
<br><br>
'''NOTES:'''
<br>
* This function can be disabled in the configuration menu.
* Number of walk assist levels correspond to number of configured assist levels.
<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Cruise === 
Enable or disable the cruise function with a long hold of DOWN button at speeds above 8 km/h (approximately 5 mph). If the function is enabled it will by default save the current wheel speed and maintain it for as long as the DOWN button is pressed. The cruise symbol will light up to let the user know that the function is active. 

It is also possible to enable a feature where you enter the desired wheel speed and the cruise function will automatically go to and maintain that speed. More information on how to enable and use the different functions can be found under the configuration menu.
<br><br>
'''NOTES:'''
<br>
* This function can be disabled in the configuration menu.
* Use with safety in mind.
<br>

<br>


=== 0: General Setup ===
{|
| '''Submenu number''' || '''Configuration name''' || '''Default value''' || '''Description'''
|-
| 0 ||Unit|| Metric || Set (0) for metric units (km/h and kilometers) or (1) for imperial units (mph and miles).
<br><br>
|-
| 1 || Maximum wheel speed || 50 ||  Enter your speed limit (by law) to run legal on public roads. The motor will fade out from -0.5 km/h to +2,0 km/h. Tip: Europe has generally a speed limit of 25 km/h for E-Bikes.
<br><br>
|-
| 2 || Wheel circumference || 2050 || Enter your wheel circumference so that speed and distance is correctly calculated.
<br><br>
Tip: Search on Google how to measure wheel circumference. But for a quick setup with ball park values use: 26'' wheel = 2050;  27'' wheel = 2150;  27.5'' wheel =2215;  28'' wheel = 2250;  29'' wheel = 2300.
<br><br>
|}
<br>


=== 1: Battery Setup ===

{|
| '''Submenu number''' || '''Configuration name''' || '''Default value''' || '''Description'''
|-
| 0 || Maximum current from battery || 16 ampere || Set maximum allowable current to be pulled from the battery. This value is limited internally by the firmware to the safe value of 18 ampere.
<br><br>
|-
| 1 || Battery low-cut-off voltage || 39 volt || The controller will reduce power to stay over this limit! Calculate the limit by multiplying amount of cells in series with the safe cut-off-voltage per cell, which is usually between 2.8 - 3.0 volts. Example: 39.0 volts for: 13 cells in series * 3.0 volts = 39.0 volts.
<br><br>
Tip: The standard Samsung cells allow down to 2.75 V but you need some safety margin because not all cells have exactly the same capacity. But setting a too large value you loose range and power. I like to use the value of 29 V for a 36 V battery pack (= 10 cells in series).
<br><br>
|-
| 2 || Number of cells in series || 13 || Set this value so the battery state indicator works properly. This value can be any integer from 7 to 14
<br><br>
Example values: 7 for 24 V battery; 10 for 36 V battery; 13 for 48 V battery; 14 for 52 V battery.
<br><br>
|-
| 3 || Battery internal resistance || 130 milliohms || Set this value so the battery state indicator does not display a lower state of charge when pulling a lot of power from battery and the voltage sags.
<br><br>
Explanation: If you set the value to 0, you will see the battery state indicator fluctuating whenever the motor draws current from the battery. This is due to the internal resistance in the battery. The fluctuation will disappear and be filtered out with a correct value.
<br><br>
How to calculate the battery pack resistance:<br>
1. Limit the battery current to a known value, e.g. 10 amps<br>
2. Read the voltage drop when motor is pulling the 10 amps<br>
3. Calculate the resistance value
<br><br>
Example for 10 amps current, R = U / I, R = 1.2 volts drop / 10 amps, R = 0.120 = 120 milliohms.
<br><br>
|-
| 4 || Battery voltage (SOC) || - || Measured and continuously updated battery voltage State Of Charge (SOC). This value is filtered using the battery pack resistance. 
<br><br>
Tip: Here you can evaluate and test how the set internal resistance of the battery affects the voltage reading.
<br><br>
|}    
<br>


=== 2: Battery Capacity Setup ===

Under this configuration menu you can set parameters to display the state of charge of your E-Bike battery. If this function is enabled it will display how many watt-hours have been consumed since last charge and what percentage remains of the battery. Depending on preferences it is possible to set so that percentage of consumed charge is displayed instead of percentage of remaining charge.

Tip: If this function is enabled you will be able to see percentage of charge in the temperature field on your display. To enable or disable just click the ON/OFF-button together with the DOWN-button at the same time. Do not forget to enable and set up the function below. 

{|
| '''Submenu number''' || '''Configuration name''' || '''Default value''' || '''Description'''
|-
| 0 || Enable and set State of Charge function || 0 || Set (1) to enable function. It will display watt-hours consumed and percentage of charge remaining, i.e., display percentage value from 100 % to 0 %.
<br><br>
Set (2) to enable function. It will display watt-hours consumed and percentage of charge consumed, i.e., display percentage value from 0 % to 100 %.
<br><br>
Set (0) to disable the function.
<br><br>
|-
| 1 || Threshold voltage to reset watt-hour meter || 54.2 volt || When powering on the display this value is compared to the battery voltage. If it is lower, the battery is expected to be fully charged and the watt-hour meter is reset.
<br><br>
Tip: To find a suitable value, fully charge the battery and measure the voltage on the KT-LCD3, use a slightly lower value for the threshold voltage. 
<br><br>
Example: my 48 V battery charges up to 54.6 volts, so I set the threshold to 54.2 volts.
<br><br>
|-
| 2 || Total watt-hours of battery || 0 || Set the total capacity in watt-hours your battery has. 
<br><br>
Tip: fully charge the battery and then discharge it completely and use the measured value to input here. 
<br><br>
Tip: the capacities stated from suppliers are often too high, expect a value of around 80 % - 90 % of stated value. I use 350 Wh for my 386 Wh battery.
<br><br>
Tip: roughly calculate the capacity by multiplying the nominal voltage with the nominal ampere hours. Example: a 48 volt, 14.5 Ah battery has a nominal watt-hour capacity of 696 Wh.
<br><br>
|-
| 3 || Consumed watt-hours || - || This value represents consumed watt-hours since last reset. It is reset automatically when you power on the LCD and the battery is fully charged, i.e. above the set threshold voltage.
<br><br>
|}
<br>


=== 3: Assist Levels ===

Here you can configure how many assist levels you wish to be able to select and also their respective multipliers. The defaults should already work for most situations.

The assist level sets the motor power as a factor of the power the rider is generating on the crankshaft. For instance, if assist level 3 is chosen and configured with a multiplier of 2.0, when the rider is generating a power of 100 watts, the motor power will assist another 200 watts.

{|
| '''Submenu number''' || '''Configuration name''' || '''Default value''' || '''Description'''
|-
| 0 || Number of assist levels || 5 ||  Select the desired number of assist levels from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 9.
<br><br>
|-
| 1 || Assist level 1 multiplier || 0.5 || The value with which the human pedaling power is multiplied with.
<br><br>
Example: 0.5 * 200 W (human power) = 100 W assist power. This results in 300 W total power.
<br><br>
|-
| X || Assist level X multiplier || .... || The desired multiplier for assist level X.
<br><br>
|}
<br>


=== 4: Walk Assist ===

Here you can enable or disable the walk assist function. And also configure the motor duty cycle in each and every enabled assist level. The defaults should work for most situations.

The walk assist PWM value sets the motor duty cycle. It is an open loop controller. A PWM value of 30 will set the target duty cycle to 30. Maximum settable PWM in the walk assist function is limited to a value of 100.

'''NOTES:'''
* There are only as many walk assist levels as there are assist levels. This is configured under 3: Assist Levels.
* Carefully test and set appropriate values.
* The function is only active in speeds below 8 km/h or around 5 mph.
<br>

<br>


=== 5: Cruise Function (BETA) ===

Here you can enable or disable the cruise function. The function can be activated when the bike is traveling at speeds above 8 km/h or around 5 mph and the user presses and holds the DOWN button. 

The cruise function has two modes of operation depending on user preference. It can, when activated, save the current speed and maintain it. Or the user can set a desired target speed and the cruise function will accelerate/decelerate to the set speed and then maintain it instead. Both modes of operation are activated the same way as described above.

If it is preferred to set a target speed and let the cruise function maintain that speed there are two ways in which the user can set the speed. The first way is through the configuration menu. The second way is by enabling the cruise display in the odometer field in the Main Screen Setup. This will display an extra sub field where the target speed is displayed in the odometer field. Pressing the UP or DOWN buttons will not change the assist level in this sub field, instead, it will change the target speed.
<br><br>
'''NOTES:'''
* The cruise function only works at speeds above 8 km/h or around 5 mph.
* The motor power will not exceed set power limits.
<br>

In this menu the UP and DOWN buttons will increment or decrement target speed. The target speed is displayed in the odometer field and is enabled (1) by default. Set (0) to disable.
<br><br>
|-
| 4 || Release-to-maintain || 0 || (NOT ACTIVATED DUE TO SAFETY EVALUATION) Set (1) to enable or set (0) to disable the release-to-maintain feature. When this feature is enabled the user does not need to hold the DOWN button to keep the cruise function active. Instead, it deactivates when the user represses the DOWN button or any other button.
<br><br>
|-
<br>


=== 6: Main Screen Setup ===

In the Main Screen Setup it is possible to configure and customize the main screen.
<br><br>

=== 8: Motor Temperature Protection ===

In this sub menu it is possible to enable or disable the throttle or the motor temperature protection function. Both can not be activated at the same time because they use the same hardware to operate. If the motor temperature sensor is installed it is not possible to use the throttle and do NOT enable throttle if that is the case.

This motor temperature protection eliminates overheating. Without this function and under heavy loads it would result in permanent damage/loss of torque. See: '''[[TSDZ2 motor demagnetized due to overheating]]'''. You can only use and enable this feature if you have installed the [[How to install motor temperature sensor| motor temperature sensor]].

'''How it works:'''

If you have installed the [[How to install motor temperature sensor| motor temperature sensor]] and you enable the function, you will be able to see the motor temperature in the temperature field of the display. When the set minimum motor temperature threshold is reached, the motor current will start to be limited. If the temperature keeps rising this will result in even more current, and therefore overall power, limitations. If the maximum motor temperature is reached the current will be completely limited.

The temperature value on the display will blink if the motor current is being limited. As the function limits the current more it will blink faster corresponding to higher limitations on current. Finally, if the current is completely limited, the blink rate will be very fast.

{|
| '''Submenu number''' || '''Configuration name''' || '''Default value''' || '''Description'''
|-
| 0 || Temperature limit or throttle || 0 || This sub menu is by default set to (0). This means neither throttle nor motor temperature limit function is enabled. Set (1) to enable the motor temperature control or set (2) to enable the throttle.  
<br><br>
NOTE: Do NOT enable throttle if you have installed the [[How to install motor temperature sensor|motor temperature sensor]]. If you have the sensor installed you need to either have the motor temperature limit function enabled or everything disabled, i.e. set to either (1) or (0).
<br><br>
|-
| 1 || Minimum temperature || 75 °C || Set the minimum motor temperature at which the motor current will start to be limited.
<br><br>
|-
| 2 || Maximum temperature || 85 °C || Set the maximum motor temperature at which the motor current will be completely blocked, i.e., motor shutoff.

| 0 || Motor voltage type || 0 ||
Depending on type of motor, set appropriate value so that FOC calculations are correctly executed. The voltage of the battery does not matter, this value should always be set depending on type of motor.
<br><br>
* Set (0) for 48 V brushless motor (TSDZ2 52 V version has a 48 V brushless motor).
* Set (1) for 36 V brushless motor.
* Set (2) (EXPERIMENTAL) for the 48 V brushless motor, high cadence mode. Maybe not good for the motor, use at your own risk. Probably only suitable for the 36 V motor.
* Set (3) (EXPERIMENTAL) for the 36 V brushless motor, high cadence mode. Maybe not good for the motor, use at your own risk. Probably only suitable for the 36 V motor.

| 1 || Current ramp up || 5 amps per second|| Set value that defines acceleration. Higher value corresponds to faster acceleration. Be careful not to select too fast acceleration.
<br><br>
|-
| 2 || Motor assistance startup without pedal rotation || 0 || Select (1) to enable or select (0) to disable. Recommended to keep disabled (0) if you do not have brake sensors installed.
<br><br>
|-
| 3 || Set odometer || 0 || Set the odometer to preferred value. Increase the value by pressing UP button or press and hold to have the value increment automatically. Decrease the value by pressing the DOWN button or press and hold to have the value decrement automatically.
