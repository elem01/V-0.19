=Why it is important to calibrate the torque sensor?=

Some torque sensors on TSDZ2 were found to have low sensibility due to a bad calibration. On this case, the torque sensor could only measure up to 10 kgs of force on the pedals while a good calibrated torque sensor can measure up to 40 kgs, which is 4x more! Why this is important? because if you do like Mountain Biking, when you stop you want a motor fast response, you will put your max force on the pedals and with a calibrated torque sensor you will get 4x more assistance from the motor.

=How to verify if my torque sensor is well calibrated=

Go to LCD and on configuration menu, advanced data, look at torque sensor ADC value. With no force applied to pedals, the ADC value should be between 25 and 30. Here are values from my well calibrated torque sensor and measures while applying force to pedals and measuring the force using a digital fish scale:
