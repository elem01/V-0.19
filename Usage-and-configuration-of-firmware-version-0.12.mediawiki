The following applies to firmware version 0.12 only! At this moment 0.12 isn't yet released and is only available as beta firmware.

CAUTION: always use the same firmware version for both the motor controller and LCD!

NOTE: Before start using the firmware, you must configure correctly the options on LCD3. For instance, you should configure your battery low voltage cut off (battery voltage when it is discharged) and all the other parameters -- follow the next section.

KT-LCD3 shows and/or configure the following from TSDZ2 motor:

= 1. Main screen =
* '''<u>Main screen</u>''': this is the default screen after turn on the LCD.
** <u>assist level</u>: Assist level scales/amplify the torque sensor signal, if you want a higher assist level from the motor, choose the max assist level value. Assist level has 5 levels in total and user can define (on firmware configuration) a custom scale value for each level. Level 0 keep always the motor disabled.
** <u>ebike wheel speed</u>: the value can be shown in kms or mph.
** <u>battery power</u>: real time value in watts of the power being draw from the battery.
** <u>battery state of charge</u>: 6 different levels. When battery is empty, the empty symbol on LCD will also blink (state of charge is based on battery voltage and can be setup on the motor controller firmware configuration)
** <u>lights</u>: enabled with a button up long press, the motor controller will enable the ebike lights. LCD backlight will also be enabled. (backlight intensity can be setup on the motor controller firmware configuration).
** <u>brake</u>: LCD symbol is enabled when user press the ebike brakes, good to check that sensor brakes are working.
** <u>walk assist</u>: although it is implemented on LCD, it is not yet implemented on the motor controller. Enabled with a button down long press.
** <u>odometer field</u>: the following information will cycle with on/off button click
*** <u>battery voltage</u>: see your battery pack voltage.
*** <u>battery current</u>: see the current being draw from your battery pack.
*** <u>battery power</u>: see the accumulated battery power (in watts/hour) draw from your battery pack, since last battery full charge. This value is automatically reset when LCD turns on and battery voltage equals to charged battery voltage - this value can also be reset or set to a custom value on the configurations.
*** <u>pedal cadence</u>: see the pedals cadence in rotations per minute.
** <u>battery state of charge in percentage</u>: this value can be shown as an option on the temperature field. The percentage is based on the accumulated battery power draw from your battery pack and user can define on LCD configurations menu, the battery pack total watts/hour.
** <u>offroad mode</u>: if you have enabled the offroad mode (see configuration section below) this can be activated with the ON/OFF and UP button combination and deactivated with the ON/OFF and DOWN button combination. When active, the assist symbol above the assist level will start blinking. Offroad mode is disabled by default. In many countries offroad mode may only be used on private property.

= 2. Max battery power screen =
Motor controller will automatically choose a battery current in a way to limit the max battery power usage. The battery current value will never be higher than the max battery current setup on the configurations screen. Long click on on/off and up buttons to enter on this screen. Up and down buttons to increase/decrease the value. Long click of on/off button lo leave.
NOTE: this functionality cannot be used when offroad mode is enabled. Disable offroad mode first.

= 3. Configurations screen =
Long click on up and down buttons to enter on this screen. On/off button click to enter on subscreens and on/off button click to cycle on subscreens, long press  on/off to exit menue

The standard Samsung cells allow down to 2.75V but you need some savety margine because not all cells are discharging in the same way, but by setting too high you loose range  power on a discharged battery and capacity  I like 29V for 10 Cells  but 30V is saver

== 3: Assist level setup ==

Here you can choose how many assist levels are used (the ones you can choose on LCD3 when clicking up and down buttons). You can also choose the max power value in watts that motor will use to assist you.

== 5: motor temperature protection ==

This feature is for protecting your motor from overheating and avoid permanent damage/loss of torque -- see here: '''[[TSDZ2 motor demagnetized due to overheating]]'''. You can only use and enable this feature [[How to install motor temperature sensor|if you installed the motor temperature sensor]].

=== How it works ===

On LCD3 temperature field you will be able to see the motor temperature value. Once the configured minimum motor temperature value is hit, the motor current will start to be reduced and as long as it increases, the more the 
current will be reduce. After hitting the configured maximum motor temperature value, the motor is shutoff.

The temperature value shown on LCD3 will blink when the motor current is being limited and will blink faster for higher rates of limited current. Finally, if the motor is shutoff, the blink rate will be very fast.


Possible configurations on LCD3:



{|
| '''submenu number''' || '''configuration name''' || '''default value''' || '''description'''
|-
| 0 || enable motor temperature sensor || 0 (disabled) || NOTE: if you don't have the [[How to install motor temperature sensor|motor temperature sensor installed]], you should disable this option and ignore the next configurations.
|-
| 1 || enable current limiting || 0 (disabled) || limit the motor current to avoid the motor get over the max temperature.
|-
| 2 || min temperature || 75 degrees Celsius || motor temperature value at which the motor current will start to be limited.
|-
| 3 || max temperature || 85 degrees Celsius || motor temperature max value at which the motor current will be zero / motor shutoff.
