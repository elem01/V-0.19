= Wire the STLinkV2 to the TSDZ2 wheel speed sensor cable =

The microcontroller chip that need to be flashed with the firmware is the STM8S105. The needed wires from the STLinkV2 are GND, RST and SWIM, which are to be connected to pins on the plug for the wheel speed sensor cable.

You can either connect directly to those pins, or acquire and set up a plug to connect to that cable.

NOTE: the wires from the STLink should be short, like 10 centimeters, or you will probably get errors while trying to flash. If you need a long cable, try to use an USB extension instead.

== To connect directly: ==

This is quite straightforward using female-ended jumper cables as are typically supplied with the STMLink adapter.  See [[https://youtu.be/S2SRKu6-Qyw this Youtube video]], but in summary

# Remove the black plastic ends from one end of the jumper leads by lifting the small retaining tab and gently slipping them off to leave the metal connector underneath
# put heatshrink over the metal ends to prevent shorts (not essential, but wise)
# slightly enlarge the holes since the motor plug pins are a little thicker than male jumper lead ends, e.g. by inserting a male jumper rotated 45 degrees.
# Connect them in as follows with the flat of the cable plug at the bottom:
## GND to the bottom left pin
## SWIM to the bottom right pin
## 5V to the top pin

== To acquire and make a plug to connect ==

You may wish to do this if you frequently flash your motor or dislike the direct pin connection method above.  Some options are:

# buy an extra speed sensor and cut the sensor from the cable and so you will have a cable with a connector that you can use only for programming - be careful, it appears some speed sensors (eg with Y Splitter for light cables) do not have the wires connected required for flashing
# buy a speed sensor extension cable (have not confirmed myself if all wires for flashing are present)
# cut the cable to wire the needed wires for flashing and keep the other wires intact - this will work perfectly and you can avoid to buy the extra wheel speed sensor

Here is the list of wires:
The connections to STLinkV2 clone:
* purple wire connect to STLinkV2 RST pin (Potentially optional, did not appear to be needed flashing from Windows)
* orange wire connect to STLinkV2 GND pin
* black wire connect to STLinkV2 SWIM pin
* brown wire connect to STLinkV2 VCC/5V pin (Optional - For those who want to flash without a battery attached)

= Download and flash the firmware =

# [https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stvp-stm32.html Download STVP for Windows here]. This software is from the STM8S105 manufacture for flashing the firmware. NOTE: if you are on Linux or MAC, you can use other alternative tool. For instance, [https://opensourceebikefirmware.bitbucket.io/development_tsdz2/Various--2018.04.18_-_original_firmware_and_debug_session_using_OpenOCD.html on Linux you can use stm8flash].
# [https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2-Smart-EBike/releases Download the firmware hex file from here]. Pick the file with name TSDZ2_xxxxxxx.hex.
# Flash the firmware (Program Memory tab) with the motor controller powered on. Select the proper processor type, both the TSDZ2 controller and the LCD3 display use a stm8s105x6 processor.

== Flash firmware on Linux ==

Both the TSDZ2 and the LCD3 use a stm8s105x6 processor.<br>

NOTE: when running stm8flash and if you are using for instance Linux Ubuntu, you may need to run it using 'sudo stm8flash xxx' to get the stm8flash working.

First backup everything (just to be sure):<br>
<code>stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s105?6 -s opt -r TSDZ_orig_opt.bin</code><br>
<code>stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s105?6 -r TSDZ_orig.bin</code><br>
<code>stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s105?6 -s eeprom -r TSDZ_orig_eeprom.bin</code><br>

Erase protection:<br>
<code>echo "00 00 ff 20 df 00 ff 00 ff 00 ff 00 ff 00 ff" | xxd -r -p > option_bytes_pwm_n_channels_enabled.bin</code><br>
<code>stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s105?6 -s opt -w option_bytes_pwm_n_channels_enabled.bin</code><br>

Flash firmware:<br>
<code>stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s105?6 -w TSDZ2-vxxx.hex</code><br>
