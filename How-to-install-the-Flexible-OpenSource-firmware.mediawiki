= Introduction =

To use this firmware, other than owning a TSDZ2 motor, you need will need to buy the KT-LCD3 display or Bafang 850C LCD display.

Although KT-LCD3 and Bafang 850C LCD signals are compatible with TSDZ2 motor controller, they have different connectors so you will have to connect this LCD cable wires to the original TSDZ2 display cable by yourself, but this is a simple soldering task.

'''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj8GxKHut3o Jbalat did a series of videos explaining how to install the firmware]''' (please take note that some links on the video may be out of date).

If you are afraid to do the installation, you can ask at a local ebike shop as they should easily be able to do it as the technical difficulty is small.

'''NOTE:''' For the TSDZ2 motor configurations found on online shops (36V, 48V, 52V, whichever power in watts, with throttle or without) the motor controller is just the same. The only relevant difference is brushless motor inside, that there are only 2 different: 36V and 48V motor (52V systems use the 48V motor).
