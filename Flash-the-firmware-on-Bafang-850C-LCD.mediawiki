'''WARNING:''' There is no way to backup the original firmware. Once you erase the original firmware you will never be able to go back.

Download the firmware binary file from here: https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2-Smart-EBike/releases/tag/v0.19.0

= How to open the LCD =

# use something thin to force open the front cover, by making force on the sides of the case
# remove the hard plastic layer that is on top of the LCD
# remove the 2 little screws that fix the LCD and the board to the case

= Flash the firmware =

== JTAG SWD connector ==

The JTAG SWD pins are available on the board, on the pads as seen on next picture, with the following JTAG pins:

{|
| '''Pad number'''<br>(from left to right) || ''' JTAG name '''
|-
| 1 || GND
|-
| 2 || NRST
|-
| 3 || SWCLK
|-
| 4 || SWDIO
|-
| 5 || VCC 3.3V<br>
(no need to connect if LCD is already powered on)
|}

== Software to flash ==

To flash the firmware, use the software tool that works on your operation system to flash the STM32F103 microcontrollers.

On the very first time, you will need to first erase and/or unlock the microcontroller.

===Linux===

Use ''stm32flash'' or ''OpenOCD''.<br>
''OpenOCD'' is usefull if you want to develop and do debug otherwise the ''stm32flash'' is the most indicated.

===Windows===

Use the '''STM32 ST-LINK Utility'''. Here the main steps:
* Target Chip erase
* Load bin file (load the firmware bin file)
* Target program
