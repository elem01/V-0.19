= Install TSDZ2 on full suspension bicycles =

See here how to install: [[How to install TSDZ2 on a full suspension bicycle]]

= Brakes =

== Should I install the brake sensors? ==
A: Yes because that way you will avoid motor being working while you brake, that way saving battery energy and put less stress on the system in general (some say this will help to avoid damage of the nylon gear).

== Can I use a brake sensor for hydraulic brakes or the "hidden wire brakes sensor"? ==
A: Yes, see here how to install: [[How to install brake sensors]].

== Can I use "hidden wire brakes sensor" on TSDZ2 no throttle version? ==
A: Yes, see here how to install: [[How to install brake sensors]].

= Nylon gear and metal gear =
Nylon gear at left and metal gear at right:

When you buy a TSDZ2 motor, it will come with the nylon gear. The metal gear is available as optional part on the online shops, you can buy it but you will need to install by yourself.

== Should I install the metal gear? ==
The nylon gear is more weak than the metal gear and many users report that it fails (but this depends on different factors). You can for instance, buy a metal gear and keep it as a spare part that you can use if nylon gear fails.

= Clutch =

The sprag clutch is a one way bearing in the tsdz2 ebike torque sensing motor that transfers your pedal torque to the main gear which is attached to the chain ring. After some time, this gear may began slipping/failing. Here is a video from jbalat showing how it happens when sprag clutch is failing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWlz4xw3pI8

== How to repair clutch ==

'''1. Buy a new main gear''' (includes the sprag clutch bearing)<br>
You can buy a new main gear, that includes the sprag clutch bearing, [http://www.pswpower.com/ven.php?cargo.2017-2s-mact on PSWPower(about 30 euros)] or in any other shop.

'''2. Install the new main gear<br>
See this video from jbalat showing how to remove and install the main gear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-SY0rGMEMo

= Flexible OpenSource firmware =

== Why stock LCDs VLCD5 and XH18 do not work ==

When I received my TSDZ2 it come with VLCD5. This LCD is very limited, for instance it can't show basic information like battery voltage.
Because our Flexible OpenSource firmware has advanced features it was found desirable to have a LCD that we can develop firmware for and that way we get the flexibility we need. On May 2018, a research was done and was selected LCD KT-LCD3 because:
* is signal compatible with the TSDZ2 motor controller
* is programmable with the same tools as the TSDZ2 motor controller firmware (we found that stock VLCD5 from TSDZ2 can't be programmed!)
* is cheap and popular, easy to buy from many online shops that ship to worldwide
* we already developed our own Flexible OpenSource firmware for KT motor controllers and we wanted to reuse our knowledge to our other projects

== Are there plans to make the firmware compatible with stock LCDs VLCD5 and XH18 ==

Would be possible but that way the advanced features would not be available and this firmware would have small advantages over the original firmware. We are not trying to save money, users that want the advanced features of our firmware will need to spend some money and time.
