= Nylon gear and metal gear =
Nylon gear at left and metal gear at right:

When you buy a TSDZ2 motor, it will come with the nylon gear. The metal gear is available as optional part on the online shops, you can buy it but you will need to install by yourself.

== Should I install the metal gear? ==
The nylon gear is more weak than the metal gear and many users report that it fails (but this depends on different factors). You can for instance, buy a metal gear and keep it as a spare part that you can use if nylon gear fails.

See here how to install the TSDZ2 gear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTbDKN2GzNE 

= Brakes =

== Should I install the brake sensors? ==
A: Yes because that way you will avoid motor being working while you brake, that way saving battery energy and put less stress on the system in general (some say this will help to avoid damage of the nylon gear).

== Can I use a brake sensor for hydraulic brakes or the "hidden wire brakes sensor"? ==
A: Yes, they both can be used. You can buy them in many online shops like PSWPower, on the section of parts for KT motor controllers. But note that you will need to wire them by yourself using [https://opensourceebikefirmware.bitbucket.io/kunteng_lcd3/LCD3_on_TSDZ2--Wire_KT-LCD_to_TSDZ2.html this information].

The "hidden wire brakes sensor" needs in addition the 5V wire and that wire is only available on the TSDZ2 throttle version!!

== "hidden wire brakes sensor" on no throttle version ==
A: This is an advanced install. Since "hidden wire brakes sensor" needs a 5V wire and that wire is not available on the TSDZ2 no throttle version, an option is to take the 5V wire from the LCD. Next pictures shows that, were 5V wire were connected to LCD3 programming header.

First, I hole was created for the extra 5V wire (black wire):

= Flexible OpenSource firmware =

== Why stock LCDs VLCD5 and XH18 do not work ==

When I received my TSDZ2 it come with VLCD5. This LCD is very limited, for instance it can't show basic information like battery voltage.
Because our Flexible OpenSource firmware has advanced features it was found desirable to have a LCD that we can develop firmware for and that way we get the flexibility we need. On May 2018, a research was done and was selected LCD KT-LCD3 because:
* is signal compatible with the TSDZ2 motor controller
* is programmable with the same tools as the TSDZ2 motor controller firmware (we found that stock VLCD5 from TSDZ2 can't be programmed!)
* is cheap and popular, easy to buy from many online shops that ship to worldwide
* we already developed our own Flexible OpenSource firmware for KT motor controllers and we wanted to reuse our knowledge to our other projects

== Are there plans to make the firmware compatible with stock LCDs VLCD5 and XH18 ==

Would be possible but that way the advanced features would not be available and this firmware would have small advantages over the original firmware. We are not trying to save money, users that want the advanced features of our firmware will need to spend some money and time.
