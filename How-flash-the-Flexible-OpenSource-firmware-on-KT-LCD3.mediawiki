= Buy STLinkV2 clone =

To be able to flash the firmware (both for TSDZ2 motor controller and KT-LCD3), you will need the cheap clone of STLinkV2, that you can buy on EBay as cheap as 2.3â‚¬

= Wire the STLinkV2 to the LCD3 =

Open the LCD3 and find the flashing pins top right side with label J7. From left to right on J7 pins, connect the  following pins:

* pin1: connect to STLinkV2 5V pin
* pin2: connect to STLinkV2 SWIM pin
* pin3: connect to STLinkV2 GND pin
* pin4: connect to STLinkV2 RST pin

= Download and flash our firmware =
# [http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stsw-link004.html Download STLink utility for Windows here]. This software is from the STM8S105 manufacture for flashing the firmware. NOTE: if you are on Linux or MAC, you can use other alternative tool. For instance, [https://opensourceebikefirmware.bitbucket.io/development_tsdz2/Various--2018.04.18_-_original_firmware_and_debug_session_using_OpenOCD.html on Linux you can use stm8flash].
# [https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TongSheng_TSDZ2_motor_controller_firmware/tree/master/TSDZ2_flexible_opensource_and_KT_LCD3_firmwares Download the firmware hex file from here]. Pick the file with name KT_LCD3_flexible_opensource_firmware-vxx.hex.
# Erase the STM8 as this way the read protection will be disabled. If you don't disable the read protection/erase, next step will fail.
# Finally, flash the firmware. PLEASE NOTE that you need to keep pressed the LCD3 power button while flashing.
