I was trying to discharge fast and fully my battery and for that I was running TSDZ2 motor at max current possible, near the 18 amps. I verified that my motor got very hot and I even got cut offs from the motor controller because it knows that motor is very hot in some way. On the next day, I noted that my motor was asking the same power as usual but it had only like half of the force/torque!! After some comparison with other ebike running with same TSDZ2, I found that my motor wasn't working properly and so I decided to open it.

I think the motor got to much because their is signs of that. Although the coils could be in short circuit, they aren't but I verified that the magnets are much weak on the more brown/burned side (I verified the attraction to a piece of metal) and searching on google I found:

''The Curie temperature of high-grade Neodymium (with added terbium and dysprosium) is 320C / 600F. However, common neo magnets are made from the cheapest grade, and can start to lose some of their magnetism at around 80C (170F).''

''E-bike motor magnets are a grade that is slightly higher than the cheapest variety, because they are often subjected to higher temps than they should be by unsuspecting customers. Years of posted experiments by real E-bikers on endless-sphere have produced a commonly held rule-of-thumb to avoid heating your E-bike motor to above 95C (200F).''

Next I went and exchanged the motor for a new one I had in stock and I got back the full torque of TSDZ2!!
