# Static Torque Calibration Methods

## Weight + Lever Arm
* Accurate
* Reproducable
* No special calibrated equipment needed.

## Spanner + Spring Balance

* Requires things you probably have directly on hand
* balance accuracy is needed
* difficult to get reproducible or accurate results

# Power Measurement

## Hill Climb

The hill climb seems a good way to measure power without needing anything to be calibrated. (as long as you live somewhere with hills, or a multi-storey carpark with tight ramps).
