#Linearity and Interchangeability of TSDZ2 Sensors

Unknown

# Static Torque Calibration Methods

## Weight + Lever Arm
* Accurate
* Reproducable
* No special calibrated equipment needed.

## Spanner + Spring Balance

* Requires things you probably have directly on hand
* balance accuracy is needed
* difficult to get reproducible or accurate results

# Power Measurement

## Hill Climb
