The KT-LCD3 is signal compatible with TSZD2 motor controller however it uses a different connector so you will need to do the wiring by yourself. I usually use 2.54mm breakaway male and female header as connectors.

On the market, you can find TSZD2 motor with and without throttle connection. The cable that goes from the motor controller to LCD is different and here are the details -- you need to identify your cable signals (use a multimeter to measure between GND and P+ battery voltage):

6 pin controller (usually this is a TSDZ2 without throttle):
{|
| '''wire color''' || '''function''' || '''description'''
|-
| green || P+ || battery voltage
|-
| black || GND || ground
|-
| white || Vin || ground when LCD disabled and P+ (battery voltage) when LCD is  enabled
|-
| brown || UART TX motor controller || sends digital data to LCD
|-
| orange || UART RX motor controller || receives digital data to LCD
|-
| purple || brake || this signal is active low, meaning that when brakes are not active, this wire has 5V and with brakes active this wire has 0 volts.
|}

8 pin controller (usually this is a TSDZ2 with throttle):
{|
| '''wire color''' || '''function''' || '''description'''
|-
| blue || P+ || battery voltage
|-
| black || GND || ground
|-
| red || Vin || ground when LCD disabled and P+ (battery voltage) when LCD is enabled
|-
| brown || UART TX motor controller || sends digital data to LCD
|-
| yellow || UART RX motor controller || receives digital data to LCD
|-
| green || brake || this signal is active low, meaning that when brakes are not active, this wire has 5V and with brakes active this wire has 0 volts. Wired with the 5V wire and black GND wire for 3 pin throttle
|-
| white || 5V ||
|-
| orange || throttle || wired with the 5V wire and black ground wire for 3 pin throttle
|}

= Connections between KT-LCD3 and TSDZ2 LCD cable =
{|
| '''KT-LCD3 wire color''' || '''TSDZ2 controller wire function'''
|-
| red wire || (P+) battery voltage
|-
| blue wire || Vin
|-
| black wire || GND ground
|-
| green wire || UART TX motor controller
|-
| yellow wire || UART RX motor controller
|}

You can wire the brakes to brake wire and you will also need to wire the GND wire. If you are using a “hidden wire brake sensor”, you will also need to connect the 5V wire.

For the throttle, you will need to connect the throttle wire, the GND and 5V wire.
