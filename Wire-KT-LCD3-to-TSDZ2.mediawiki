The KT-LCD3 is signal compatible with TSZD2 motor controller however it uses a different connector so you will need to do the wiring by yourself. I usually use 2.54mm breakaway male and female header as connectors. 

TSDZ2 connector is [https://www.higoconnector.com HIGO] Mini-A, which is not on the website and (supposedly) is discontinued. So, something must be cut up to get connectors.
* Get a spare controller $30 from PSWPower and use the cables, seems best value as you will have a spare controller pcb
* Get Y speed sensor / light cable. Gives 2M 1F connector when cut up. $25
* Get an [https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/tongsheng-tsdz-speed-sensor-extension-cable-110cm-length/1971954_32833464583.html tsdz speed sensor extension cable] $39 (do these have 6 conductors inside?)

KT-LCD connectors looks like Higo [https://www.higoconnector.com/products/z209bm-p-00-a0-1000/K999K#title mini-B Z209], available from [https://www.e-bike-technologies.de/index.php/en/connectors/higo/dustcaps-for-higo-mini-b-connectors EBike Technologies].

On the market, you can find TSZD2 motor with and without throttle connection. The cable that goes from the motor controller to LCD is different and here are the details -- you need to identify your cable signals (use a multimeter to measure between GND and P+ battery voltage):

You can wire the brakes to brake wire and you will also need to wire the GND wire. If you are using a “hidden wire brake sensor”, you will also need to connect the 5V wire.

For the throttle, you will need to connect the throttle wire, the GND and 5V wire.

Some example of soldering wires :

(nb. Correct way is to stagger the cuts so that they would not short even without heatshrink, this makes a small neat bundle)
