The KT-LCD3 is signal compatible with TSZD2 motor controller however it uses a different connector so you will need to manage the wiring connection yourself.

TSDZ2  [https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wiki/blob/master/tsdz2-plug-dimensions.jpg 6 way connector] is [http://www.higocon.com/en/product/?24_38.html Higo HG-F.S-Z*09A] (Mini-A). [https://www.higoconnector.com European Higo ] site no longer lists it, and (supposedly) is discontinued.

The simplest option is to cut your existing display cable at the display, and either splice it to the KT-LCD3 cable (easiest), or wire it directly to the KT-LCD3 board.  Obviously this renders your original display useless without splicing its cable back together.  If you want either throttle or brake sensor functions, you will also need to connect those components to wires in the original cable (the KT-LCD3 plays no part in those functions)

To avoid cutting your original display cable, you would need to find the source of [https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wiki/blob/master/tsdz2-plug-dimensions.jpg Higo Mini-A dimension connector]

The KT-LCD3 kit comes with an extension cable with plug, ready to be spliced.  KT-LCD3 connectors looks like Higo [https://www.higoconnector.com/products/z209bm-p-00-a0-1000/K999K#title mini-B Z209], available from [https://www.e-bike-technologies.de/index.php/en/connectors/higo/dustcaps-for-higo-mini-b-connectors EBike Technologies].

TSZD2 motors models are sold with or without a throttle connection. The cable that goes from the motor controller to LCD is different and here are the details -- you need to identify your cable signals (use a multimeter to measure between GND and P+ battery voltage):

You can wire the brakes to brake wire and you will also need to wire the GND wire. If you are using a “hidden wire brake sensor”, you will also need to connect the 5V wire.

For the throttle, you will need to connect the throttle wire, the GND and 5V wire.

Some example of soldering wires :

(nb. Correct way is to stagger the cuts so that they would not short even without heatshrink, this makes a small neat bundle)
