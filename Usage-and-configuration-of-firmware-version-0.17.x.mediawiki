The following applies to firmware version 0.17.x only!

CAUTION: always use the same firmware version for both the motor controller and LCD!

NOTE: Before start using the firmware, you must configure correctly the options on LCD3. For instance, you should configure your battery low voltage cut off (battery voltage when it is discharged) and all the other parameters -- follow the next section.

= KT-LCD3 information and configurations =

== 1. Main screen ==
* '''<u>Main screen</u>'''
** <u>Assist level</u>: assist level sets the motor power as a factor of the power that rider is doing on the pedals. For instance, if current assist level is 3 and if this level is configured as a factor of 2.0, when rider is doing on the pedals a power of 100 watts, the motor power used will then be 200 watts.<br>The assist level is changed by pressing UP and DOWN buttons.
** <u>Ebike wheel speed</u>: the value of wheel speed in kms or mph.
** <u>Motor power</u>: power used by the motor (in watts) that is being draw from the battery.
** <u>Battery state of charge</u>: Battery state of charge based on battery voltage. There are 6 different levels. When battery is near empty, the battery symbol will be empty and blinking and the motor power will be reduced up to battery being totally empty.<br>The battery voltage used to calculate the state of charge has in consideration the battery pack resistance to avoid floating when power is being draw from the battery (the battery pack resistance value is set on configurations menu).
** <u>Lights</u>: enabled/disable with a long press of UP button (LCD back light will also be change, depending on the configurations) and the motor controller will enable/disable the ebike lights.
** <u>Brake</u>: Brake symbol is enabled when user press the ebike brakes (good to check that sensor brakes are working).
** <u>Walk assist</u>: enabled/disable with a long press of DOWN button. Although it is implemented on LCD, it is not yet implemented on the motor controller.
** <u>Offroad mode</u>: if you have enabled the offroad mode (see configuration section below) this can be activated with the ON/OFF and UP button combination and deactivated with the ON/OFF and DOWN button combination. When active, the assist symbol above the assist level will start blinking. Offroad mode is disabled and inactive by default. We do not recommend you to activate offroad mode on public roads. In many countries offroad mode may only be used on private property.
** <u>Motor temperature / battery state of charge in percentage</u>: this field can show either the motor temperature (when the sensor is installed), the battery state in percentage or none (you can switch what is shown by pressing POWER and UP buttons simultaneously).
*** <u>Motor temperature</u>: motor temperature in degrees Celsius. When the power power is being limited due to over temperature, this field will blink (configure the temperature limits on configurations menu).
*** <u>Battery state of charge in percentage</u>: this percentage value is based on the accumulated battery power draw from your battery pack (set options on configurations menu).
** <u>Odometer field</u>: this field can show a few variables that are logic grouped in sub fields. You can change between fields by pressing ON/OFF button and sub fields by quick pressing UP button followed a long press UP button (you will see temporary the field and sub field number blinking on wheel speed field).
*** <u>1. Distance</u>
**** <u>1.0 Trip distance</u>: can be reset by quick pressing DOWN button followed a long press DOWN button (you will see trip distance value blinking if you keep pressed DOWN button and after 3 seconds the value will reset).
**** <u>1.1 Distance since power on</u> this value is automatically reset at power on. You can also reset by quick pressing DOWN button followed a long press DOWN button (you will see trip distance value blinking if you keep pressed DOWN button and after 3 seconds the value will reset).
**** <u>1.2 Odometer</u>: can be set to a specific value on the configurations menu.
*** <u>2. Battery state of charge (not shown if this feature is disable on configurations menu)</u>
**** <u>2.0 Battery state in percentage</u>
**** <u>2.1 Battery discharged total watts hour value</u>
*** <u>3. Battery</u>
**** <u>3.0 Battery voltage</u>
**** <u>3.1 Battery current</u>: the current being draw by the motor.
*** <u>4. Pedals</u>
**** <u>4.0 Rider pedal power</u>: in watts.
**** <u>4.1 Pedal cadence</u>: in RPM.
**** <u>4.2 Pedal torque</u>: in N.m.
*** <u>5. Motor</u>
**** <u>5.0 Motor temperature</u> in degrees Celsius.

== 2. Motor maximum power screen ==
Here you can set a limit to the motor maximum power. This can be useful for various reasons, like controlling the battery range for long travels.

Access this screen by long pressing ON/OFF and UP buttons. Press UP and DOWN buttons to increase/decrease the value. Exit this screen by long pressing the ON/OFF button.

How it works: the motor controller will automatically choose a battery current in a way to limit the motor maximum power usage (even with the battery voltage drops with the discharging, you will get a continuous motor maximum power assistance).<br>The battery current value will never be higher than the max battery current setup on the configurations screen.

'''NOTES:'''
* this functionality cannot be used when offroad mode is enabled. Disable offroad mode first.

== Configurations screen ==
Long press on UP and DOWN buttons to enter on this screen. Press UP or DOWN buttons to enter on subscreens and press ON/OFF button to move to next subscreen. To exit, long press the ON/OFF button.

{|
| '''submenu number''' || '''configuration name''' || '''default value''' || '''description'''
|-
| 0 || Maximum wheel speed || 50 ||  Put in your speed limit (by law) to run legal on public roads , the motor will fade out from - 0.5 km/h to +2,0 km/h in Europe often 25 km/h
|-
| 1 || Wheel perimeter || 2050 || Measure your wheel perimeter (search on Google on how to do it). First estimates: 26'' wheel = 2050;  27'' wheel = 2150;  27.5'' wheel =2215;  28'' wheel = 2250;  29'' wheel = 2300

== 1: Battery ==

{|
| '''submenu number''' || '''configuration name''' || '''default value''' || '''description'''
|-
| 0 || Maximum current of battery || 16 (amps) || This is the maximum current that will be pulled from your batteries by the motor. This value is limited internally by the firmware to the safe value of 18 amps.
|-
| 1 || Battery low cut-off voltage || 39 (volts) || The controller will reduce power to stay over this limit! usually 2.85-3.05 volts per cell of (39.0 volts for: 3.0 volts * 13 cells = 39.0 volts). The standard Samsung cells allow down to 2.75V but you need some safety margin because not all cells are discharging in the same way, but by setting too high you loose range power on a discharged battery and capacity, I like to use the value of 29 for 36V battery pack/10 cells.
|-
| 2 || Number of cells || 13 || This value is needed to make battery state indicator work.<br><br>
This value can be a number from 7 to 14 -- example values: 7 for 24V battery; 10 for 36V battery pack; 13 for 48V battery pack; 14 for 52V battery pack.
|-
| 3 || Battery pack resistance || 130 (miliohms) || This value is needed to make battery state indicator work.<br><br>
If you use a 0 value, you will see the battery state indicator fluctuating when the motor startup and pull energy from the battery. If you use the correct value, the fluctuation will disappear.
<br><br>
How to calculate the battery pack resistance:<br>
1. limit battery current to a know value like 10 amps<br>
2. read the voltage drop when motor is pulling the 10 amps<br>
3. calculate the resistance value, example for 10 amps current, R = U / I, R = 1.2 volts drop / 10 amps, R = 0.120 = 120 miliohms.
|-
| 4 || Battery voltage SOC || - || Battery voltage State Of Charge (SOC) that is filtered using the battery pack resistance. Here you can see how the configured battery pack resistance affects battery voltage SOC.

|-
| 1 || Increment or decrement || 0 || You can switch if the percentage should go form 0% - 100% or from 100% to 0% - set 0 for the first option and 1 for the other.
|-
| 2 || Voltage to reset Wh counter || 54.2 (volts) || On power on the LCD, this value is compared to the battery voltage and if is lower, means that battery is fully charged and the Wh counter is reset.<br>To find the correct value for this field, fully charge your battery and measure the voltage on LCD3, use a slight lower voltage value for this field, example: my 48V battery charges up to 54.6 volts and so I use the value 54.2.
|-
| 3 || Total watt hour || 0 || Adjust the battery pack power. You can fully charge the battery and then discharge it fully and use the measured value to input here. The value that supplier give you is often to a quite high, you should expect a value of maybe 85% - 90% (I use 350 for my 386 wh battery).
|-
| 4 || Used  power (wh)  of battery || 0 || Counted value for used watt hour from the battery. This value is reset automatically when you power on the LCD and the battery is fully charged.

== 3: Assist level setup ==

Here you can configure how many assist levels can be used and change their respective multipliers. The defaults should already work for most people.

Assist level sets the motor power as a factor of the power that rider is doing on the pedals. For instance, if current assist level is 3 and if this level is configured as a factor of 2.0, when rider is doing on the pedals a power of 100 watts, the motor power used will then be 200 watts.

{|
| '''submenu number''' || '''configuration name''' || '''default value''' || '''description'''

|-
| 1 || Assist level 1 multiplier || 0.5 || The value with which the human pedaling power is multiplied. E.g. 0.5 * 200W (human power) = 100W assist power which results in 300W total power.
|-
| 2 || Assist level X multiplier|| .... || The desired multiplier for assist level X.
|}

== 4: Startup power boost ==

Here you can configure the BOOST feature. This feature gives a peak of power to the motor at startup. The amount of time of the peak as also the amount of motor power during the peak, can be configured. You can also disable this feature if you prefer.

{|

|-
| 0 || Feature toggle|| 0 ||  1 to enable the boost feature, 0 to disable
|-
| 1 || On startup only / everytime || 1 ||  0 to enable power boost only when startup and bicycle wheel speed is equal to zero; 1 to enable power boost everytime pedal cadence or torque sensor are zero
|-
| 2 || limit boost power to max battery power value || 0 || 1 to enable power boost limit to the Max battery power value and 0 to disable.
|-
| 3 || boost time || 2.0 (seconds) || -
|-
| 4 || fade out/transition time || 3.5 (seconds) || fade out from boost power to regular power.
|-

|-
| 6 || assist level X boost multiplier || - || The desired boost multiplier for assist level X.
|}

== 5: Motor temperature protection ==

This feature is for protecting your motor from overheating and avoid permanent damage/loss of torque -- see here: '''[[TSDZ2 motor demagnetized due to overheating]]'''. You can only use and enable this feature [[How to install motor temperature sensor|if you installed the motor temperature sensor]].

=== How it works ===

On LCD3 temperature field you will be able to see the motor temperature value. Once the configured minimum motor temperature value is hit, the motor current will start to be reduced and as long as it increases, the more the 
current will be reduce. After hitting the configured maximum motor temperature value, the motor is shutoff.

The temperature value shown on LCD3 will blink when the motor current is being limited and will blink faster for higher rates of limited current. Finally, if the motor is shutoff, the blink rate will be very fast.

Possible configurations on LCD3:
{|
| '''submenu number''' || '''configuration name''' || '''default value''' || '''description'''
|-
| 0 || Feature toggle || 0 || 1 to enable the temperature control, 1 to disable. NOTE: if you don't have the [[How to install motor temperature sensor|motor temperature sensor installed]], you should disable this option and ignore the next configurations.
|-
| 1 || min temperature || 75 (°C) || motor temperature value at which the motor current will start to be limited.
|-
| 2 || max temperature || 85 (°C) || motor temperature max value at which the motor current will be zero / motor shutoff.
|}
