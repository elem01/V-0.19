= Why should you use the Flexible OpenSource firmware =

Here the feedback from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQGmuYA6Vg jbalat], a long time user of TSDZ2 that already did more than 5000kms on it:

''I think the new firmware has given the motor new life. (...) it feels much more responsive and actually gives you more power as you spin out instead of dropping off like the original firmware. That is what I wanted so it now feels more like the Bosch motor.''

''In fact the old firmware would feel like you are hitting a brick wall the faster you peddle but with this firmware it feels like a breath of fresh air. The faster you want to go the more it helps you.''
''When I got right near the end and still had some battery left I pumped the power up to 550W and was able to ride comfortably at 38km/hr with little effort. I would not have been able to do this with the old firmware with a battery that was so low.''
