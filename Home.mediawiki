Feedback from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQGmuYA6Vg jbalat] user about our Flexible OpenSource firmware for TSDZ2 and LCD3:

''I think the new firmware has given the motor new life. (...) it feels much more responsive and actually gives you more power as you spin out instead of dropping off like the original firmware. That is what I wanted so it now feels more like the Bosch motor.''
