= About the TSDZ2 Flexible OpenSource firmware/embedded software =

This OpenSource firmware/embedded software adds advanced features and customization to the TSDZ2 motor that are usually only available on expensive motors from big brands. It also allows the use more advanced LCD displays like the Bafang 850C color LCD or the KT-LCD3.

This firmware drives the motor more efficiently, making it stronger and using less battery energy. The ebike will also be more responsive, fast and agile.

The Bafang 850C color LCD and KT-LCD3 show advanced information like battery voltage, rider pedal power in watts or motor temperature. All configuration is available to the user via the LCD display!

This firmware is being actively developed for free by the community of users; some of these developers work professionally developing this type of technology for very well known companies.

= Why should you use it? =

Feedback from users:
* ''the TSDZ2 now feels more like the Bosch motor''
* ''the motor is more efficient, stronger, it's feel like I have a new motor''
* ''the bike feels very responsive and is very fast and agile whenever you need it to''
* ''the info which is shown on LCD makes the total package way better''
* ''this is GOLD. I still have a smile on my face''

= Features =
(work in progress to write all the features)

* '''Motor'''<br>
** '''FOC motor control'''<br>FOC motor control algorithm generates motor torque with maximum energy efficiency. Users are reporting that motor has higher torque and their batteries last longer and give longer range.<br>
** '''Motor power control'''<br>Control is of motor power rather than motor current, which maintains the motor power assist level when battery has reduced charge and lower voltage.<br>
** '''Current ramp control'''<br>Current ramp control. The acceleration can be configured via the display. Users can change the ramp speed that can help to extend the life of the plastic gears etc.. Users can decide to have a very fast torque response from the motor and a lower one to improve the life of the motor parts, or maybe the battery current ramp, or for safety reasons having low torque, etc.
** '''Motor max current'''<br>The user can configure the maximum current that the motor pulls from the battery, from 1 up to 18 amps. This can be useful for instance to limit battery current from a small battery and so keep in a safe range that will extend battery life.<br>
** '''Motor max power'''<br>User can set the motor max power, in watts, that motor pulls from the battery (a configuration on LCD). This can be useful for instance to limit battery power usage to ensure extended range.<br>
<br>
* '''Battery'''<br>
** '''Wide range of battery voltages: 24 V up to 52 V battery (7S up to 14S)'''<br>Users can configure a battery with any number of cells in series from 7 to 14.<br>
** '''Battery low cut-off voltage'''<br>Draining cells to empty is highly stressful and significantly reduces their lifespan.  Users can configure the battery low cut-off voltage to optimize its life of the battery.<br>
** '''Battery SOC and resistance '''<br>The LCD indicates the battery SOC (State of Charge) based on the battery voltage and it has in consideration the battery pack resistance (configurable) to avoid fluctuations in the reading when motor is pulling current from the battery.<br>

= How to install =

If you prefer to not install our Flexible OpenSource firmware yourself, you can buy a TSDZ2 motor and LCD with the firmware pre-installed at [https://www.electrifybike.com/store/c37/TSDZ2_Flexible_Open_Source_Firmware_Products.html#/ www.electrifybike.com]. This store is a friend of the project and actively supporting the development of our firmware by donating 10% of the sales proceeds.
